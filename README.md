**A simple game for the Arduboy. From 1 to 100, guess the number!**

## Installation

Grab the `.hex` from Releases (eventually). You can use some [Python Utilities](https://github.com/MrBlinky/Arduboy-Python-Utilities) or the excellent [GUI Toolset](https://github.com/randomouscrap98/arduboy_toolset) created from those scripts to get the game on your Arduboy.
